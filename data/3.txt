On Page Two we met five
.colblue
functions:
.colgreen
 sum  range  len  max  min
.col
.n
Try all of them again to make sure you know how to use them.
.p
Now for some real power -
we're going to learn how to create our own functions!
Let's start with a simple one -
a function to
.colblue
double
.col
a number.
It will work like this after we create it:
.n
.code
double(70)
.endcode
.pre
140
.endpre
Let me show you how to create the
.colblue
double
.col
function then I'll explain it:
.n
.code
def double(n):
    d=n+n
    return d

.endcode
.colgreen
def
.col
is short for
.colblue
define
.col
and tells Python that we are defining a new
.colblue
function
.col
called
.colgreen
double.
.col
.n
.colgreen
n
.col
is a memory box for storing the number we want doubled.
We could give it any name we like.
.n
Note the colon
.colgreen
:
.col
at the end of the first line.
.n
Python is smart enough to know that there must be more to come
so it replies "tell me more ..."
.n
In the next two lines the
.colblue
four spaces
.col
at the start of the line are very important and must be there.
.n
Finally we tell Python to
.colgreen
return
.col
the value we have worked out.
.n
An empty line tells Python that we have finished our new function.
.n
Now see if you can make it all happen on your computer.
.p
OK! Now repeat the whole exercise to produce a
.colgreen
triple
.col
function.
