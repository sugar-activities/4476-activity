Here's the code from Page 16 again
.u
.popup16d
.r
Hopefully the only part I need to explain is the
.colgreen
.font3
global dx
.col
.font
 line.
This tells Python that
.colgreen
.font3
dx
.col
.font
is a memory box outside of the
.colgreen
.font3
process()
.col
.font
function.

Your turn ... your rectangle moves very slowly ...
can you speed it up?
.u
.popup17a
.r
Your rectangle only moves across the screen ...
can you add vertical movement?
.u
.popup17b
.r
Now for the last bit - how to make the rectangle disappear when the player
clicks on it?
.p
First we have to know where on the screen the player has clicked - this is how:
.n
.colgreen
.font3
point=pygame.mouse.get_pos()
.col
.font
.p
Second we have to know whether this point is on the rectangle - here's how:
.n
.colgreen
.font3
if rect.collidepoint(point):
.col
.font
.p
Finally we have to have way to stop drawing the rectangle after a successful hit.
I chose a real sneaky way - I just set
.colgreen
.font3
dx
.col
.font
to zero.
.p
Time to show that you're a Master Python Programmer -
.pushxy

finish the "Chase the Rectangle" game
all by yourself!
