dice
How can Python possibly roll a die?
For the moment we'll settle for randomly picking a number between 1 and 6.
First we have to tell Python we want to use the random stuff:
.n
.code
import random
.endcode
Then this is how to pick a number between 1 and 6:
.n
.code
print random.randint(1,6)
.endcode
.clear
.p
Your turn - print out 100 die throws.
.u
.popup7a
.r
Did you notice how I added a comma so my numbers went across the screen?
.n
.n
Now ... can you repeat the experiment using two dice?
.u
.popup7b
.r
So which number comes up most?
We're going to use the computer to find out.
.n
Here's the plan: we'll throw the two dice 1,000 times
and count how often each number comes up.
.n
The biggest number is 12 so we'll need a list of 12 counters
which I'll call
.colgreen
.font3
c.
.col
.font
.n
Here's a neat way to set up the counters all set to zero:
.code
c=[0]*13
.endcode
.r
Why 13? Because Python starts counting at zero so
.colgreen
.font3
c[12]
.col
.font
will now be counter number 12.
.n
See how far you can get before looking at my answer.
I set up a function called
.colgreen
.font3
test()
.col
.font
so I could run the experiment many times without lots of retyping
by just typing
.colgreen
.font3
test()
.col
.font
.n

            Study it carefully - there's lots to learn here.
