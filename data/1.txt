Hi! This tute will show you how to program a computer
using the Python language.
The best approach is to have two computers side-by-side -
one with this tutorial, the other for doing the work on.
.p
.it
terminal.png
Start up Terminal and then type
.colgreen
python
.col
followed by the
.colgreen
enter
.col
key
- you should see
.colblue
>>>
.col
this means Python is ready for your commands!
 Windows users - click this button:
.popup1a
.e
.u
Just to get you started and to see how easy it is, type
.colgreen
.font3
2+3
.font
.col
.p
Make sure that you always press the
.colgreen
enter
.col
key
after typing.
.p
Inside the computer are heaps of boxes.
You can give these boxes names - as short as you like -
.colgreen
a
.col
or real long -
.colgreen
thisisareallylongboxname
.col
We'll use short names to save lots of typing.
.p
To put something in a box is real easy - here's some examples to try:
.p
.mark
.code
a=5
b=3
c='hi'
d='Peter'
e=[1,2,3,4]
f=[8,'cat']
.endcode
.inset.3
.n
Now try playing with your memory boxes -
here's some examples:
.n
.code
a+b
a-b
c+d
e+f
.endcode
.endinset
Play around lots - notice that some expressions produce an error.
.n
The things in quotes are called
.colblue
strings
.col
eg
.colgreen
.font3
'Peter'
.col
.font
.n
and the things in square brackets are called
.colblue
lists
.col
eg
.colgreen
.font3
[1,2,3,4]
.col
.font
