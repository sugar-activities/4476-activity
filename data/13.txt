Start from scratch so you can type
.colgreen
.font3
 gedit times.py
.font
.col
 (we don't want to wipe out our previous work safely saved in
.colgreen
.font3
a.py
.font
.col
do we?)
.n
Do the 75 times table again but use a function this time so that
we can use our work for any number by just changing the
.colgreen
.font3
75.
.font
.col
My work:

Now repeat the dice experiment from page 7
using gedit - call the function
.colgreen
.font3
dice
.font
.col
this time and, as always, start from scratch by typing
.colgreen
.font3
gedit dice.py
.font
.col
 My answer:
.popimg

Finally use gedit to redo the
.colgreen
.font3
shuffle
.font
.col
function from page 10.

If you've got this far we're ready to move on to the really
exciting stuff with Python -
creating games.
We'll need to be able to put pictures on the screen,
move the mouse pointer,
work out what the player is doing and so on.
Some great people have made this a lot easier by doing all this stuff
for us - it's all in a module called
.fg
pygame
.efg
But first we'll have to learn how things are laid out on the screen and how
color works. To get you started, the blue display at top right
is showing you where the mouse pointer is right now.
.p
.mark
.inset.32
And if you place the mouse pointer over these colors,
you'll see how color is specified.
.endinset
.mouse
.color
