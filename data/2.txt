There's a neat story about when Einstein was young.
His Maths teacher decided to keep the class busy with this problem:
"Add up the first 100 numbers."
Einstein had the answer within seconds and didn't even use pen & paper!
Maybe you'd like to try before moving on.
Well maybe we can use the computer to do the work for us.
We'll start with the first 10 numbers to get the idea.
Please set up a list of the first 10 numbers
in a memory box called
.colgreen
.font3
t
.col
.font
 Click the yellow button to see my answer.

Now for some magic! All we have to do to get Python to add the ten numbers together
is to type
.colgreen
.font3
sum(t)
.col
.font
So back to the original problem ...
but before you start madly typing the first 100 numbers
try this instead:
.colgreen
.font3
range(100)
.col
.font
More magic eh?
.n
So now you should be able to get the answer all by yourself!
.u
.popup2b
.r
And it would be just as easy to add together the first 1,000 numbers.
Why don't you try? The answer is
.colblue
.font3
500500.
.col
.font
.n
.colgreen
sum
.col
and
.colgreen
range
.col
are called
.colblue
functions.
.col
 Here's some more for you to try:
.colgreen
 len  max  min
.col

.mark
